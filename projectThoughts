I think this project was really too much work for a beginner based off the skills I had acquired in Coding Dojo.

I spent a lot of time looking up different techniques that I hadn't been taught yet and I spent more time learning new things than I did practicing existing techniques that I was taught.

This is no fault of Coding Dojo and is more reflective of a missing ability I have to understand what was feasible with the given equipment.

In coding Dojo I learned:
most if not all the HTML elements this doucment contains
how to link my javascript and css to my html
inline event handling
CSS flex and basic styling
How to get an API onto my project
How to use queries to define elements of my HTML into variables that can be used in my Javascript functions

things I learned how to do on my own:
Use EventListeners to keep script events outside of my Markup


Dynamic DOM Element Creation - making HTML elements with my javascript with append and appendChild


main functions of my site:

Timer & timer display
To Do List
      the Dynamic DOM creation was my favorite part even though its still confusing to me. I have to give a lot of credit to Jon and Colby for pointing me
      to this technique
video change on select option change

Things I want to add:

styling based off current selected video
timer alert Sound
Task lisk keeps track of crossed off tasks
open all links in new tabs
