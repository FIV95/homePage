so im adding three variables to my javascript files.

1) Im holding a variable createBtnElement that represents the Create Button
This will recieve an event listener that listens for a click -
the function that runs if a click occurs will be called createTask
      create conditional that checks current count of "task" divs on my html
            we have to create a new variable using document.getElementByClass('task')
            this command will essentially make a list and assign my new variable name taskCountElement
                  this list length can tell us how many divs of "task" we have
                        we create variable taskLimit and set it (taskLimit = 5)
                        conditional now can compare two pieces of data
                              if (taskCountElement.length) is Greater Than (taskLimit) // if (taskCountElement.length > taskLimit)
                              If this conditional is true what happens??
                                    we break??? how do we stop the the createTask function from running?
                              we also need to create a message/error that tells the user the cap has been met - indicating they need to remove a task or clear the list.

2) the second variable newTaskElement is an element representing the text field newTask

3) the third variable newTaskName holds the information of newTaskElement's VALUE (WHATEVER THE USER TYPES)

the function createTasks needs to try and do the following:
the parameter it will take in is (task)
-- so far we have createTask(task){} --
in our HTML we have 5 task divs
      inside we have
            1 checkbox
            1 label
            1 span that holds our custom checkbox
            1 p tag that holds the task name

I think we have two solutions to this problem
1) everytime we use createTask- the function we made
      we create a new "task" div
            that div will be located in the class "tasks"
            that div will contain the same elements as our blank task
                  but that div will contain a unique <p> tag
                  that <p> tag will contain the newTaskName
With this method -
      What happens when we keep adding tasks?
            should there a cap for visual clarity and user ease?
                  I think the cap should stay to 4/5
                  THIS MEANS WE NEED to write conditional - go back to line 4
